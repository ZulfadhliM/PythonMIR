# Music Information Retrieval (MIR) in Python

Some state-of-the-art music information retrieval techniques written in Python.

## Features

* Onset Detection: estimates the onset times of an audio signal
* Pitch Estimation: estimates the pitches of a monophonic audio signal

## Getting Started

The main.py file shows an example of using the MIR techniques. The audio signal that is under analysis is the guitar riff from the track "Day Tripper" written by The Beatles in "1" album. The graph below shows the results:

## Dependencies

* NumPy
* SciPy
* matplotlib
* Soundfile (optional)

## Future work

Will add more MIR techniques e.g. spectral peaks extraction, inharmonicity coefficient estimation, music segmentation and etc.
